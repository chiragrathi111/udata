Errors from NodeJS(client):

Error 1: node-gyp errors

	gyp ERR! build error 
	gyp ERR! stack Error: `make` failed with exit code: 2
	gyp ERR! stack     at ChildProcess.onExit (/usr/local/lib/node_modules/npm/node_modules/node-gyp/lib/build.js:270:23)
	gyp ERR! stack     at emitTwo (events.js:87:13)

	gyp ERR! stack     at Process.ChildProcess._handle.onexit (internal/child_process.js:200:12)
	gyp ERR! System Darwin 14.5.0
	Solution: My best suggestion is always install Nodejs by using NVM(Node version Manager)

	sudo apt-get install build-essential libssl-dev

	Always use stable version of NodeJS

	Ex: v8.12.0 (Latest LTS: Carbon) — It should show green color

Error 2: certificate is invalid [Cannot read property ‘curve’ of undefined]

	error: [Client.js]: Failed to load user “maersksea-ica” from local key value store. Error: TypeError: Cannot read property ‘curve’ of undefined

	at <anonymous>

	Above scenario tried to register a new user with wrong CAadmin certificates

	Solution: certificate you provided is invalid check using below online tools

	https://ssldecoder.org/
	https://www.sslshopper.com/certificate-key-matcher.html
Error 3: wrong chaincode name | instantiation failed, but try to invoke

	error: [client-utils.js]: sendPeersProposal — Promise is rejected: Error: make sure the chaincode rate has been successfully instantiated and try again: getccdata public/rate responded with error: could not find chaincode with name ‘rate’

	at /home/server/Downloads/fabric-ca-network/client-node/node_modules/grpc/src/client.js:586:7

	Solution: Generally join peers to channels is like to identify which peers belong to which channel, same way install chaincode in all peers OK but to identify which chaincode belongs to which channel, we need to successfully instantiated chaincode, this is a one-time transaction and happened in channel

	try to resolve problems with instantiating chaincode, if you encounter docker problems refer docker section.

Error 4: Failed to create the channel ‘public’

	Reason: the transaction is not signed with an admin key

	Solution: To create a channel we need admin credentials such as private key & public certificate(Ex: x.509)

Error 5: reg channel creation error

	NodeJS Logs: [2018–10–05 11:29:21.358] [DEBUG] Create-Channel — response ::{“status”:”BAD_REQUEST”,”info”:”error authorizing update: error validating ReadSet: readset expected key [Group] /Channel/Application at version 0, but got version 1"}

	Error: container is marked for removal and cannot be started

	Sometimes, when you kill / remove containers, it would sit up in “Removal Queue” or in “Dead Status”, that would be mounted forever and will not allow you to run your next steps.. So you have to remove the containers using below command. this kills all the containers that are marked in DEAD state.

	Solution: docker rm $(docker ps — all -q -f status=dead)

Error No : 18
	Error: sendPeersProposal — Promise is rejected: Error: chaincode with name ‘chain-code-name’ already exists

	Situtation — Occurred while instantiating chaincode

	Solutions: This error mostly would occur due to the fact that, chaincode would have already instantiated on peers. So get rid of this, remove the node_modules & do npm install once it finishes fine, restart the “install chaincode” and then “instantitaet chaincode”.

	Or

	Use different chain_node id

Error No : 19
	CRIT 008 Error on outputBlock: Error writing genesis block: open ./channel-artifacts/genesis.block: no such file or directory

	Solution : Create channel-artifacts folder before you run the command

Error No : 20
	Error: readBlock -> DEBU 00a Got status: &{FORBIDDEN} Error: can’t read the block: &{FORBIDDEN}

	Solution : Make sure, before you start your network no other containers are running behind. This error occurs due to permission issues, that containers are in conflict with existing containers. Goahead, kill the containers using docker rm -f $(docker ps -a -q) command & restart your network.

Error No : 24
	Error: could not assemble transaction: ProposalResponsePayloads do not match — proposal response: version:1 response:<status:200 >

	Solution: Make sure, yo have installed Chaincode in the peers you are trying to invoke the transactions. Set the environment variables for the peers. For instance :

	CORE_PEER_MSPCONFIGPATH=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/users/Admin@org2.example.com/msp CORE_PEER_ADDRESS=peer0.org2.example.com:7051 CORE_PEER_LOCALMSPID=”Org2MSP” CORE_PEER_TLS_ROOTCERT_FILE=/opt/gopath/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric/peer/crypto/peerOrganizations/org2.example.com/peers/peer0.org2.example.com/tls/ca.crt peer chaincode install -n mycc -v 1.0 -p github.com/chaincode/chaincode_example02/go/

Error No :25
	Error: Calling enrollment endpoint failed with error [Error: connect ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:7054]

	Solution: Regenerate Crypto Files, then point the secretKey in docker-composer-yaml file for ca-fabric (if 7054 is pointeed to CA-fabric)

Error No : 26 instantiate-chaincode-Instantiate proposal was bad
	This error would mostly occur when you try to instantiate the Chaincode.

	Solution: you should understand the basic flow how it works first?, when you install Chaincode on peers, it would mostly be successfull, but after you install and instantiate the chaincode it would perform lot of actions such as

	Scanning for Chaincode Syntax, Logical issues, etc.,
	Bundling the code together
	Trying to create a container with chaincodename-chaincode version
	So what happen is that, the “Chaincode” instantitation mostly would fail in “Syntax checking & logical issues in your chaincode”.. To identify the same, run the following command in separate terminal

	docker logs -f peer0.org1.example.com

	Here, peer should be the one where you are trying to instantiate. this will give you clear logs behind , what’s happening and where the errors are being thrown, fix the errors & re install , instantitate.. YOU SHOULD BE GOOD TO GO

Error 27: instantiate-chaincode — Error: ChannelEventHub has been shutdown
	Solution: Mostly this occurs in “instantiate-chaincode” section, eventhub will get disconnect when it finds more than one chaincode version (when you upgraded with multiple version of same chaincode). Just kill all the containers, just keep the one that’s the latest version then try install & instantitate the chaincode

Error 28: instantiate-chaincode — Error: ChannelEventHub has been shutdown
	Solution: Mostly this occurs in “instantiate-chaincode” section, eventhub will get disconnect when it finds more than one chaincode version (when you upgraded with multiple version of same chaincode). Just kill all the containers, just keep the one that’s the latest version then try install & instantitate the chaincode

Error 29: Cannot use encKey (type string) as type []byte in argument to entities.NewAES256EncrypterEntity
Error 30: instantiate Proposal was bad — Chaincode
	Solution: When you find this error,

	i) Check if you have right fabric-client & fabric-ca-client by using below command

	npm ls fabric-client

	npm ls fabric-ca-client

	Ensure, you have right compatible docker images with respect to fabric-client version.

ERROR 31: docker: Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket at unix

	Solution: sudo usermod -a -G docker $USER

	Perform this operation in your terminal, close it and re-open the terminal. if issue still persists, then re-boot your system.

ERROR 35 : affiliation validation: Failed getting affiliation ‘org3.department1

	Solutions: the issue is that the fabric-ca being used in the sample does not know about the new affiliation. By default, fabric-ca only has the following affiliations:

	org1.department1 org1.department2 org2.department1

	go to app/helper.js and update the logic like below, replace getRegisteredUser function with below logic.

var getRegisteredUser = async function(username, userOrg, isJson) {
